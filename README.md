The current version of this application includes only the UI for the application. Connects to the VM player DB, hooks to the UDP sockets, and a packaged application are to be added.

The entire codebase can be found by downloading the LaserTagApp.zip, or individual files can be found within the LaserTagApp folder.
To edit the code, you will need an updated msys2, QT (QT6 for msys64), and CMake. Paths in system environment variables may need to be added.
